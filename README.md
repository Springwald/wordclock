## Arduino Sketch files for Word Clock ##

The source code contained here is the software for a Word Clock, i.e. a clock displaying the time in words and not numbers. The clock is designed for German speaking users. For example "5:25pm" would be displayed as "ES IST FÃœNF MINUTEN VOR HALB SECHS".

As the software makes only sense if you have the same hardware, it may be of limited interest for you. The circuit design may be published here in the future.

Nevertheless, you can freely use this software if you want.
